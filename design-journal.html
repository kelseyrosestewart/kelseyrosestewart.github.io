        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:</p>
        <p>I really want to be able to build a decent portfolio website eventually. So far, I really like this class because it reminds me of algebra, which I also enjoyed. I hope to be able to build a good looking website, and be able to explore the possibilities coding has. </p>

        <h2>Week Ten</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Before the final, please write at least a few paragraphs on your design process and reasoning for the design decisions you made on your project.</p>
        <p>Response: For Project One I’m planning on doing a website about the Jonas Brothers. I want to focus on the before and after of the Jonas Brothers breakup, and what they did while they were working separately. I also want to include some fun information about their favorite colors, songs, what instruments they play, etc. Each page will be unique because of the photos of the members, which I’m hoping I can do a cool transition hover effect where it changes from a photo of them before to a photo of them now. I’ll also use color to differentiate between the four brothers (fun fact: there is actually a fourth, youngest brother who isn’t a part of the band). 
I’ll have to look closer at Jonas Brothers album art and over aesthetic, but when I think of my design, I imagine a black background contrasted with these really bright, youthful colors. I want the type to be fun as well, with some cool halftone effects on images that might help unify the images of the Jonas’s I find on the internet.
